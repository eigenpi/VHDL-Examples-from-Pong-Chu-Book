Synopsis:
---------

This repository contains all the needed source files for several 
examples from Pong Chu's book:
[1] Pong P. Chu, FPGA Prototyping by VHDL Examples: Xilinx Spartan-3 Version, Willey, 2008.
to be able to verify them on the DE1-SoC FPGA board.  

These source files include VHDL + pin assignment files, which are 
all one needs to use with Intel Quartus II projects to be able to 
generate the programming files for the FPGA.

Some of the designs were altered to adapt them and make them work 
on the DE1-SoC board. The original VHDL source files can be found 
on Prof. Chu's companion webpage for the book:
https://academic.csuohio.edu/chu_p/rtl/fpga_vhdl.html

The VHDL files in this repository are changed versions of those. 
All credit for developing these examples and explaining them in his 
book, goes to Prof. Chu.

Video demonstrations of all of these examples can be found on my youtube channel:
